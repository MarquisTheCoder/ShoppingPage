    1.) CSS/HTML (schema and design):
    c - meta tags including favicon stolen from searchspring headers
    c - navbar including all icons and links
    c - ads and banner image
    x - filter sort and search bar
    x - setting product results and pagination divs for javascript
    x - add pagination buttons and design 

    2.) JAVASCRIPT SEARCH (functionality):
    c - lay down foundation with class for accessing different api futures to make it easy on yourself
    x - test functionality for filter sorting and results in JSON first
    x - start implementing search functionality with mobile modal
    x - load search items and load search data into product page
    x - start implementing already functional search sort and filtering on product page 
    x - DONT FORGET TO CHECK FOR MSRP YOU ALMOST DID!!!

    3.) HTML/CSS SEARCH (design):
    x - start to design and style product results
    x - start to design modal for modernity and ease of use
    x - start to add MSRP zaps to found products that fit
    x - work work on cart modal

    4.) JAVASCRIPT CART (functionality):
    x - have a global state simulating REST so you can remember saved items
    x - add items to cart modal and plus or minus cart functionality
    x - YOUR ALMOST THERE

    5.) SUPERVISE AND REFINE(any ideas or improvements):
